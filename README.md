# Ole::Cukes

This is an example for writing Cucumber tests using the [OLE QA Framework](http://github.com/jkwaldrip/ole-qa-framework).

* Plain-English-like feature definitions can be found in the [features/](/features/) directory.
* Regex-matching test code can be found in the [features/step_definitons/](/features/step_definitions/) directory.
* Before-and-after code for setting up the OLE QA Framework session can be found in [features/support/env.rb](/features/support/env.rb).
* Additional support code for handling OLE QA Framework functions can be found in [lib/ole/cukes.rb](/lib/ole/cukes.rb) and [lib/ole/cukes/](/lib/ole/cukes/).
